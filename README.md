# Trump Simulator - Trump Speech AI Simulator

This is a voice simulator featuring Trump, using the generative AI model Qwen2.5 plus a Recorded Grammar Database (RAG) to provide realistic conversations that are converted to Trump's voice playback via ElevenLabs TTS. Users can enter questions to interact with the AI to simulate Trump's style and tone.

## Technical Framework

- Unity Engine (version 2022 or above)
- Qwen2.5 model (open source large language model provided by Alibaba)

- C# script integration
